## Intro
The goal of this solution is to create an API that can handle CRUD operations on two resources.  
The `Provider` resource is a regular model with `string` and `decimal` fields.  
The `ServiceArea` is more interesting because it includes a `MultiPolygon` field. This means you can run spatial filters and operations on this resource.     
A `provider` can create one or more `service area` resources.  
There's no authorization and the API is open to the public(for the next couple of days).  
My goal was to write the minimum amount of code necessary to create this API *and* implement the fastest solution. Of course, this wouldn't have been possible without tools and technologies like Django, PostGIS, tastypie, and Swagger.        
Thanks to these tools, I only had to write 20 lines of custom code to create an API that can handle:  
* `PUT GET POST DELTE` operations for a `Provider` resource
* `PUT GET POST DELTE` operations for a `ServiceArea` resource
* Many standard spatial filters on the `ServiceArea` resource
This solution comes with a comprehensive suite of tests that you can run using Djagno's test runner.  

## Limitations
I deployed this solution to an Amazon EC2 instance. Security and speed of server were not my focus.   
The speed of operations using the API, however, was my focus and I believe I've achieved this by simply using `PostgreSQL` + `PostGIS`.   
Please note that I've set `DEBUG` to `True` in Django settings and everything is being served by the built-in Django webserver which is managed by `supervisor`.  
A more robust solution would call for tools like Gunicorn and nginx. Once again, I belive these to be out of the scope of this problem.     

## How to Use the API  
I'm using Swagger to document *almost* all possible operations. Please visit [this url](http://52.14.61.103:8000/api/doc) to see the API documentation.   
Yet, some of the operations can be better visualized here due to limitations in `django-tastypie-swagger`.   

#### Changing the ServiceArea Resource  
The `polys` field of the `ServiceArea` resource takes a `MultiPolygon` geometry object which is tricky to build a JSON object for.  
Here's a sample payload for making a `POST` call that adds a service area resource:   
POST [http://52.14.61.103:8000/api/v1/service_areas/](http://52.14.61.103:8000/api/v1/service_areas/)  
```json
{
  "name": "newrasdfasdoute",
  "polys": {
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [
          [
            1,
            1
          ],
          [
            1,
            2
          ],
          [
            2,
            2
          ],
          [
            1,
            1
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ],
    "type": "MultiPolygon"
  },
  "price": "22.40",
  "provider": "/api/v1/providers/1/"
}
```  
*Note that you need to have a `provider` with Id `1` before you can create the above service area resource. The easiest way to create a `provider` resource is using the Swagger UI [here](http://52.14.61.103:8000/api/doc).*  

#### `contains` And Other GeoDjango Spatial Filters  
Not only you can do a `contains` query, other standard GeoDjango filters are also available. All of this is possible because `django-tastypie` has native support for `GeoDjango`.   
Here's a sample `GET` call for the `contains` filter:     
GET`http://52.14.61.103:8000/api/v1/service_areas/?polys__contains={"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.475233, 37.768617]}`   

This call returns service areas that contain the `point` given:  
```json
{
    "meta": {
        "limit": 20, "next": null, "offset": 0, "previous": null, "total_count": 1},
    "objects": [
        {
            "name": "randomName",
            "id": "1",
            "polys": {
                "coordinates": [[[
                    [-122.511067, 37.771276], [-122.510037, 37.766390999999999],
                    [-122.510037, 37.763812999999999], [-122.456822, 37.765847999999998],
                    [-122.45296, 37.766458999999998], [-122.454848, 37.773989999999998],
                    [-122.475362, 37.773040000000002], [-122.511067, 37.771276]
                ]]],
                "type": "MultiPolygon"
            },
            "resource_uri": "/api/v1/service_areas/1/",
            "provider": 1,
            "price": "10"
        }
    ]
}
```
